This is a Kata to practice Test Driven Development with the "Cards game" example.
This Card game consist of the following:
  1. There are two players, each player receive the same number of cards. There are as much rounds as cards have player 1 or player2.
  2. Each round will be won by the player that has the highest rank in card for this round. Cards are given in order so, the first card
